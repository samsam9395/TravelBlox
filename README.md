## About The Project

##### Description

A travel planning website that eases the hassle of planning travel schedules by combining map direction, calendar timeline and travel blog with a beautiful and easy-to-use drag and drop interface.

Enables users to share, collect and import travel schedules made by others.

<summary><em> The reason behind this project </em></summary> 
<blockquote>
<p> Pandemic has stopped a lot of travel plans in the past few years. Recently locations around the world are beginning to open for travel, I think it's the perfect timing to build a travel planning website.  :wink: </p>

<p>
I've been planning my trips with spreadsheets and note-takers, in which I had to switch platforms between calendars, maps and a lot of times many personal travel blogs for planning ideas.

So here it is, **TravelBlox** that integrates everything altogether :blush: :sparkling_heart:
